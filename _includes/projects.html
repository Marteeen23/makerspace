    <p> In this project, we designed and constructed a robotic gripper with three degrees of
      freedom, controlled using hand gestures. This robotic gripper finds many applications in
      industrial and automation processes. The robot takes input through visual feed and
      processes it using Computer Vision. This processed data is sent to an Arduino Uno
      microcontroller via serial communication, which in turn controls the servo motors. 
      The entire assembly was modelled, and 3D printed.

    <p> A sophisticated gear mechanism was used to control the claws of the gripper. 
      There is always a scope for improvement of this project. The following are a few
      improvements that can further increase the capabilities of this robot:<br>
      1. Including a feedback loop using sensors or cameras near the gripper to increase
      efficiency.<br>
      2. Using object detection to make the robot completely autonomous.<br><br>

  <h2>CV Based Ball-Balancing</h2>

    <p> This project was focused on understanding the control systems applications. It basically 
      uses Computer Vision for locating the ball on the platform and then using the feedback mechanism, 
      i.e, PID Controller in our case, automatically generates the tilt of the surface for 
      balancing the ball on the platform. The servo motors are initially at an angle of 90 degrees and they 
      turn by the angles that is given as an output of the PID Controller. All this is integrated on the 
      Arduino UNO Microcontroller. All the communication between Arduino and the Python Code for OpenCV and controller 
      is handled by Pyserial library.

    <p>  In many ways, the project exceeded our expectations by 
      being able to tilt the platform fast enough to balance the ball on it. Later on, we found out 
      that the 4 servo motors were a very high load for Arduino.If this project were to be redone, there 
      would be a few things not done the same way as with most first-time projects; but overall, 
      the project was considered to be a success.<br><br>

    <p>A quadruped bot or spider bot is a movable robot that mimics animal walking. 
      The bot made by Makerspace lab has four legs each with two degrees of freedom. 
      Two servos were used to control the hip joint and knee joint. 
      A Raspberry Pi Pico microcontroller has been used to control the servos.</p>

    <p> The entire chassis has been 3D printed. We programmed the microcontroller through an attached 
        laptop via serial communication. Programmed sequences were created for the bot to get-up,
        move forward and backward, turn left and right. This was achieved after rigorous experimentation
        of various configurations of the servos.</p>

    <p>A quadruped has a huge advantage over wheeled locomotion. It can adapt to rough and uneven surfaces.
       It can easily navigate over rough terrain, unreachable to humans. </p>

    <p>This robotic arm prepared by Makerspace lab has five degrees of freedom. 
      It is made almost entirely of 3D printed parts that snap together, with
      three movable joints, a rotating base, and a gripper. An Arduino Uno microcontroller
      to control the bot while servos were used for the movable joints. 
      The arm is about 20 inches long. The design was optimized to save time during 3d printing,
      through the use of hollow fill.

    <p>  The lower and middle joints are controlled using standard servos,
       whereas the upper joint and gripper are controlled using micro-servos for higher precision.
       All the servos can be controlled using the microcontroller, one step each, independent of each other.
       This robotic arm can be used for a variety of research purposes that may require high precision 
       or include hazardous environments. Future plans include making the bot self-reliant by using 
       computer vision and increasing the load-bearing capacity by using new gripper mechanisms such as magnetic holders.

    <p>A plotter is a type of printer used to print vector graphics. A smaller version was made capable of printing any graphic having size less than 120 * 240 mm. Two stepper motors have been used for movement. Both the axis have independent motion i.e the pen holder and the printing bed can be independently moved. </p>

    <p> A micro servo motor has been used for lifting the pen up and down. An arduino UNO has been used for the control of these motors. Currently we need to connect a laptop having processing software to execute the g-code. On providing the g-code file, the software sends the instructions to arduino by serial communication and thus the required motion of the stepper motors and servo motor is obtained.</p>

    <p>Automation in industries is mostly programmed to carry out a specific work. But the
exponentially growing semiconductor industry has led to the development of economically
viable sensors with pinpoint accuracy combined with the internet gives a whole new dimension
to the world of automation. The direct consequence being machines getting intelligent and very
versatile. Our work here is an attempt to extend this automation quest.</p>

    <p> Designing and standardizing appropriate tailor-made tools and equipment for women can
reduce or entirely prevent physical fatigue, which is linked to farm work. The same is the case
with farmers working in different countries under the influence of various internal and external
factors. Hence, we brainstormed to designed a bot with the broad objective to equip farmers
technologically for reducing their drudgery during the engagement in agriculture and for
enhancing their productivity. To understand the major problems and develop a solution we dug
more around them.</p>
