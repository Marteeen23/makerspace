    <p>A quadruped bot or spider bot is a movable robot that mimics animal walking. 
      The bot made by Makerspace lab has four legs each with two degrees of freedom. 
      We have used two servos to control the hip joint and knee joint. 
      A Raspberry Pi Pico microcontroller has been used to control the servos.</p>

    <p> The entire chassis has been 3D printed. We programmed the microcontroller through an attached 
        laptop via serial communication. We created programmed sequences for the bot to get-up,
        move forward and backward, turn left and right. We achieved these after rigorous experimentation
        of various configurations of the servos.</p>

    <p>A quadruped has a huge advantage over wheeled locomotion. It can adapt to rough and uneven surfaces.
       It can easily navigate over rough terrain, unreachable to humans. </p>

    <p>This robotic arm prepared by Makerspace lab has five degrees of freedom. 
      We have made it almost entirely of 3D printed parts that snap together. 
      It has three movable joints, a rotating base, and a gripper. We have used
      servos to achieve movable joints. We have used an Arduino Uno microcontroller
      to control the bot.

    <p> The arm is about 20 inches long. So, to save time while 3D printing, we used
       hollow-fill for all parts. The lower and middle joints are controlled using standard servos,
       whereas the upper joint and gripper are controlled using micro-servos for higher precision.
       All the servos can be controlled using the microcontroller, one step each, independent of each other.</p>

    <p>This robotic arm can be used for a variety of research purposes that may require high precision 
       or include hazardous environments. Future plans include making the bot self-reliant by using 
       computer vision and increasing the load-bearing capacity by using new gripper mechanisms such as magnetic holders.

    <p>A plotter is a type of printer used to print vector graphics. We have made a smaller version which is able to print any graphic having size less than 120 * 240 mm. Two stepper motors have been used for movement. Both the axis have independent motion i.e the pen holder and the printing bed can be independently moved. </p>

    <p> A micro servo motor has been used for lifting the pen up and down. An arduino UNO has been used for the control of these motors.Currently we need to connect a laptop having processing 3 software to execute the g-code. On providing the g-code file, the software sends the instructions to arduino by serial communication and thus the required motion of the stepper motors and servo motor is obtained.</p>

    </ul>
    <p>A raspberry PI will be used to do the g-code processing which in turn will send the instructions to arduino. Moreover IOT will be included as well wherein the gcode file would be directly sent to the Raspberry PI through wifi and the plotter would start printing the file.

    <p>Automation in industries is mostly programmed to carry out a specific work. But the
exponentially growing semiconductor industry has led to the development of economically
viable sensors with pinpoint accuracy combined with the internet gives a whole new dimension
to the world of automation. The direct consequence being machines getting intelligent and very
versatile. Our work here is an attempt to extend this automation quest.</p>

    <p> Designing and standardizing appropriate tailor-made tools and equipment for women can
reduce or entirely prevent physical fatigue, which is linked to farm work. The same is the case
with farmers working in different countries under the influence of various internal and external
factors. Hence, we brainstormed to designed a bot with the broad objective to equip farmers
technologically for reducing their drudgery during the engagement in agriculture and for
enhancing their productivity. To understand the major problems and develop a solution we dug
more around them.</p>
